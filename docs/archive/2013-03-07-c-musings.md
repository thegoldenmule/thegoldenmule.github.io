I had a few ideas for C# constructs, so I thought I might as well write them down. Perhaps, some day, someone can tell me why these don’t exist…

## Making Generics More Generic

Several times I’ve been frustrated by the fact that Func<TResult> has a bunch of variants. Wouldn’t it be cool it you could specify a generic definition over an arbitrary number of types? This is what I mean:

Func<T, T1, T2, T3, TResult> could become Func<T1, …, Tn, TResult> or perhaps, even better, Func<T\[\], TResult>. No, I don’t know what the full implications of this type of syntax would be, but from a purely pragmatic perspective, this would be crazy useful.

## Extensions (and Partials) Should Fulfill Interfaces

_Think about how cool this is._

I’ve run into the problem several times where I have to subclass or wrap an object I don’t own so that it fulfills an interface I do own. Wouldn’t it be cool if, instead, I could use extensions or partial classes to fulfill that interface?

## Constraints on Type Parameters Could Be Constraintier

Constraints are so cool, but I often feel limited by the constraints you can put on a type constructor. For instance, I can enforce a default constructor with new(), but I can’t enforce a constructor that takes arbitrary arguments, like new(T1, T2) or even just new(int, float). Wouldn’t that be great?
