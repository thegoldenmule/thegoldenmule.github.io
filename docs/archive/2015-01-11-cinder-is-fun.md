“Cinder is a community-developed, free and open source library for professional-quality creative coding in C++.”

In short: it’s like Processing except in a good better language with better hardware access in a better IDE (your choice!) with more opportunities for optimization.

Anyway, I made a webcam thing!

It’s now one of my many [Githubs](http://https://github.com/thegoldenmule/CameraOutline "Interesting name...")! Check it out.
