I have so many blog posts in my head–Itsy updates, a spritesheet tool I’ve been working on, a neato Flash optimization I discovered, some thoughts on the current state of gaming–more stuff than I have time to write. In fact, I’m also pecking away at the novel I began writing in November. I may be crazy, but I’m finishing that dang novel if it kills me.

Anyway, all that to say I hope to be writing more blog posts soon, so don’t worry, I’m not dead.
