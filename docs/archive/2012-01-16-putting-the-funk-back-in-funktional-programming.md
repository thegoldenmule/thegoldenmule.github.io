Whether or not you agree that JavaScript is (or can be) a functional language, we can all agree that spelling functional with a ‘k’ makes it look German. And downright funky.

But enough with stupid comments.

Apparently this thing called HTML5 is a [flash killer](http://www.infoworld.com/d/applications/microsoft-unveils-silverlight-flash-killer-555 "Whoops..."). So in the interest of science (and job security), I have been making forays into the JavaScript jungle, seeking as my prize the knowledge that will carry me through these harrowing times. In particular, I chose to remake a classic game–not just any game, mind you, the Mother of All Games: [Scorched Earth](http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/scorched-earth/ "Download it NOW"). The original was not just a spectacle of light and sound– it was a message about the human spirit: unfettered, resilient, and [funky](http://blog.diluciano.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/funky_bomb.png "Funktasrophe").

Anyway, without further ado, I’d like to introduce to you, for the first time, [Scorch3d](https://thegoldenmule.com/labs/Scorch3d/ "In 2d!")— now in 2D.

Keep in mind, this is a very early version. Does it work in IE? No, screw IE. I haven’t taken the time necessary to fidget with that. Also, right now you can use any weapon at any time. Check it out. Let me know what you think.
