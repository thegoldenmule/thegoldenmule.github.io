Flash developers have a rough reputation. Artist-turned-programmers run rampant in the Flash community, and they, unfortunately, have an extremely loud voice. I had the pleasure of sitting in a room with many of them while watching the magical  technical work of the Unity team at Unite Flash Day 2011. Basically, they explained that their awesome platform could now build SWFs and thus target FlashPlayer. It was going quite well until they decided to open up the floor for some Q&A. Lord, beer me strength. I kid you not, here are some of the questions posed by flash developers:

\* If I have an old Papervision project, will Unity magically make my game look like that sweet demo you showed us?

\* Can I export a Unity project to an FLA? I mean, I like the Unity editor and all, but I’d really like to work in Flash CS 5.

\* Hi I’m \*blah\* and I work for \*blah\*, here is how awesome I am.

\* Can I import a MovieClip into Unity?

\* Can I import a graphic into Unity?

\* Can I import a MovieClip into Unity?

\* Can I use this specific part of the .NET framework?

\* How about this specific part of the .NET framework?

Yes, it was a pretty informative Q&A session. There I was, scrambling to scratch out “Flash Developer” on my old business cards.
