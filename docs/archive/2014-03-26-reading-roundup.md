Struct packing? Pointer arithmetic? Turns out array indices started at 0 long before C even existed, and unless you guessed that this decision was guided by yacht racing in the 50s and 60s, you’d be dead wrong.

This is one of those famous papers by a genuine, old school computer scientist. The kind that probably thinks on a whole different level than you or I.
