For me, Java reads kind of like [James Joyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "No, not one of my favorites") (yes, THAT’S where the title of this post came from). Most serious programmers have at least dabbled in Java just like most avid readers have quit reading at least one of Joyce’s novels halfway through. But then there are those whack-jobs that really just can’t get enough of Java or Joyce and have all but written their own JVM (or read Ulysses, [including the dozens of pages without punctuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Bloom's_soliloquy "Don't believe me?"))– and it turns out that most of those guys are actually geniuses. For some reason Java and Joyce appeal to some deep place in the recesses of brilliant minds, but to the rest of us, it’s just too abstract (and [AbstractImpl](http://isagoksu.com/2009/development/java/naming-the-java-implementation-classes/ "Oh lord, stop with the puns")).

Enter thegoldenmule. Yes, another literary reference (click on the “About” link to find out about that one). I’m one of those on the outside looking in. I read books and pretend to understand, I program and act like I really know what a [monad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_\(functional_programming\) "Okay, I kind of do") is; but in reality Java and Joyce escape me. I know they exist and I know how to uneasily wield their power, but I have no idea how they actually came about or what’s going on just under the skin.

It’s one of those things I pray comes with experience. I’ll read more books, I’ll learn more languages and platforms and someday– probably after I grow the requisite computer-science beard, I hope to understand the Why of Java and Joyce.
