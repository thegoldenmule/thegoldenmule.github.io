**Day one**: [Read this](http://cowlark.com/2009-11-15-go/ "On Go"). Read every word, then read the comments. Then sit there for awhile and think it’s all rubbish. Maybe even read it again, sleep on it– whatever you have to do (I’m describing my usual ponderous way of long-suffering-thinking (a term I coined _just now_)).

**Day two**: read all of the links in his references section. All of them. Look up the author and read some of his other posts. Maybe this beautiful one on [Ada](http://cowlark.com/2014-04-27-ada/index.html "Ada").

**Day three**: _realize that you know absolutely nothing_.
