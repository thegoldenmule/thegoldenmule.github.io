I’ve been working through the book [_Natural Language Processing with Python_](http://www.nltk.org/book/ "Read it!") and I came across an extremely interesting fact:

Names ending with the letter ‘a’ are female 38.3 times more often than male. Likewise, names ending with the letter ‘k’ are male 31.4 times more often than female.
